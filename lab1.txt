Exercises

	1.	5 bits were used in the table referenced because there are 24 different values shown. 5 bits
		can represent up to 32 different values. Since there are more than 16 values, 4 bits cannot be
		used for the table.

	2.	6 bits can represent 2^6 or 64 different values.

	3.	7 bits can represent 128 different values. Since 6 bits can only represent 64 different values,
		7 is the minimum number of bits required to represent the number of students in CSC 230.

	6.	
		4 bits
			unsigned range
				[0, 15]
			2's compliment range
				[-8, 7]
		8 bits
			unsigned range
				[0, 225]
			2's compliment range
				[-128, 127]
		12 bits
			unsigned range
				[0, 4096]
			2's compliment range
				[-2048, 2047]
		16 bits
			unsigned range
				[0, 65536]
			2's compliment range
				[-32768, 32767]
